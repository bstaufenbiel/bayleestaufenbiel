Welcome to a reevaluation of the <em>the Old Bailey Proceedings</em>. 

 Often in early court cases scholars look at how procedural events occurred. What legislation was used to convict? How did court procedures run? What did justice mean to early modern individuals? 

 
 This project seeks to go further with court documents to view how women were treated as subjects of the criminal proceedings, but also tools of the justice system. The cases that are investigated on this site are all about women accused of infanticide between the years of 1674 and 1789. Each of the 191 cases in this study references a female midwife who was called in as an expert witness (or as a defendent) by the court to testify. There are many questions that these court records allow historians of medicine, the body, embodiment, gender, law, social and cultural history to ask.

Here are the set of questions that I am asking:

- How were indicted women treated by the male court system?
  - Why were so many women accused of infanticide?
  - Was there a more likely explanation?
- How were the midwives deployed?
  - Did the midwivesâ€™ testimony lead to a verdict or did it need to be supported by other male authority?
  - Were the midwives supposed to incriminate the accused?
  - Did the midwives portray any specialized medical knowledge?
- What do these proceedings tell us about society and gender in early modern London?
