**Causes of Death**

One of the questions that this data set raises why and how so many women were initially charged with infanticide? What circumstances did their babies die under that led the prosecution to believe them guilty of such heinous crimes? Through an investigation of the 191 court cases I separated out the various ways that babies were said to die. 

| Cause of child Death                      | Sum of Child Death|
|-------------------------------------------|-------------------|	
| Suffocation                             	| 30             	|
| Strangulation                           	| 54             	|
| Drowning                                	| 13             	|
| Abortive                                	| 3              	|
| Stillbirth                              	| 24             	|                                     	
| Miscarriage                             	| 22             	|	
| Unknown                                 	| 45                |

Though the highest single category is strangulation, it is important to note that encompassed within that category is the strangulation of the fetus by the umbilical cord at birth and other accidental aspirations due to the birthing process. 

Furthermore the large number of stillbirths, miscarriages, and presumed abortions (all three of which were rendered a verdict of innocent) are sad but normal outcomes of pregnancy. There is no reason for these types of child death to have led to criminal proceedings. What is seen with these results is a surveillance of and increaseing regulation of women's bodies. British authorities sought to cut down on deviance and poverty by criminalizing unwed mothers and children who came out of wedlock. The best way to do so was cracking down on questional births and deaths when they were able to find them. 

It is also interesing to note that 45 cases had no clear cause of death for the infant. The child was just found dead and the woman accused. The lack of information speaks more to the interest of the justice system to procsecute the woman for a charge rather than actually document the events that led to the death of the child. 

Overall, the OBP shows the hyper surveillance of women's bodies and the ways that poverty and sexuality outside of the "norm" (heterosexual white marriage) was punished.
