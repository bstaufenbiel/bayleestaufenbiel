**Why were so many women accused of infanticide?**

Many women were accused of infanticide because there was a common misunderstanding among the lay population regarding miscarriage, stillbirth, and, though it is not mentioned in the documents, Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS). 

During the early modern era, there was a monopoly on medical learning. Most medical texts were in Latin, which required specialized teaching to learn. When the first medical books were published in the vernacular, the most popular being <em> On Monsters and Marvels</em> by Ambroise Paré, it produced inaccurate depictions about “monstrous” childbirth and the female body that became widely disseminated. <em>On Monsters and Marvels</em> was reprinted for more than 300 years. The work appeared in pieces throughout the eighteenth century and was reprinted in miscellanies, magazines and popular accounts. 

**Was there a more likely explanation?**

The more likely explanations of child death were not related to infanticide. Early modern London was not the London we know today. The 1600s saw the outbreak of the Great Plague. In 1666 there was the Great Fire of London. After rebuilding, the 18th century saw mass industrialization which brought bad living conditions and pollution especially to the poor who were most susceptible to criminal accusations.
