**Did the midwivesâ€™ testimony lead to a verdict or did it need to be supported by other male authority?**

The midwives, in every example, were supported by a male surgeon, doctor, or male witness.

**Were the midwives supposed to incriminate the accused?**

They were expected to tell the truth and could lose their position as a reputable midwife if their testimony was deemed false. 

As with other types of midwifery work, with the profesionalization of gynaecology and obstetrics midwives answered to medical, secular, and religious authority. They were not trusted to remain impartial when working with other women. In most cases midwives were accompanied by barber-surgeons when they gathered evidence so the court could be sure that the midwife was not covering for the accussed woman.
