Title: Treatment of Indicted Women

**How were indicted women treated by the male court system?**

Women were censured for being child killers. For example the entry for a woman who was deemed innocent due to lack of evidence on 1693-04-26:  

> A - M - was tried for murther of her Female Bastard Child on the 2d of April instant, she being a Nurse to the Wife of one John Dennison ; there being search made for a lost Cock in the House of Office, there was found the Child lying in the Excrement; and she being searcht by the Midwives, the Symptoms of Childbearing was found upon her; but she proving by several Witnesses that her Husband was alive, the Law acquitted her of the Murther, but not without great suspicion of her being a naughty wicked Woman.

Despite testimony from the husband and other witnesses the woman was still considered a “naughty wicked women” because there was a dead child. It seems as if no one wanted to consider the possibility that the wife of John Dennison might have had the child, not A-M the nurse. There seems to be a double standard that the working woman A-M was scrutinized whereas the woman being nursed and her husband who was named, and wealthy enough to afford a nurse for his wife, were not looked into. Obviously, this is simply a possibility. In the official outcome A-M is labeled wicked and naughty. She will carry those labels with her as the court did not clear her of all suspicion, but let her go because they had no choice. 

Despite what popular imagination might lead us to believe, the percentage of women who were convicted (33%) shows that the majority of women were actually acquitted of any crime. With the intervention of doctors, midwives, and other witnesses, women were generally freed of suspicion. It is also important to note that the the number of women found guilty decreases as moving towards the end of the early modern era (1789).
